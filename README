      my $irc = Mojo::IRC->new(
                  nick => 'test123',
                  user => 'my name',

DESCRIPTION
    Mojo::IRC is a non-blocking IRC client using Mojo::IOLoop from the
    wonderful Mojolicious framework.

    If features IPv6 and TLS, with additional optional modules:
    IO::Socket::IP and IO::Socket::SSL.

    By default this module will only emit standard IRC events, but by
    settings "parser" to a custom object it will also emit CTCP events.
    Example:

      my $irc = Mojo::IRC->new;
      $irc->parser(Parse::IRC->new(ctcp => 1);
      $irc->on(ctcp_action => sub {
        # ...
      });

    It will also set up some default events: "ctcp_ping", "ctcp_time", and
    "ctcp_version".

    This class inherit from Mojo::EventEmitter.

TESTING
    Set MOJO_IRC_OFFLINE to allow testing without a remote host. Example:

      BEGIN { $ENV{MOJO_IRC_OFFLINE} = 1 }
      use Mojo::Base -strict;
      use Mojo::IRC;
      use Test::More;

      my $irc = Mojo::IRC->new(nick => 'batman', server => 'test.com');
      $irc->parser(Parse::IRC->new(ctcp => 1));

      $irc->on(
        ctcp_avatar => sub {
          my($irc, $message) = @_;
          $irc->write(
            NOTICE => $message->{params}[0],
            $irc->ctcp(AVATAR => 'https://graph.facebook.com/jhthorsen/picture'),
          );
        }
      );

      $irc->from_irc_server(":abc-123 PRIVMSG batman :\x{1}AVATAR\x{1}\r\n");
      like $irc->{to_irc_server}, qr{NOTICE batman :\x{1}AVATAR https://graph.facebook.com/jhthorsen/picture\x{1}\r\n}, 'sent AVATAR';
      done_testing;

    NOTE! "from_irc_server()" is only available when "MOJO_IRC_OFFLINE" is
    set.

EVENTS
  close
    Emitted once the connection to the server close.

  error
    Emitted once the stream emits an error.

  err_event_name
    Events that start with "err_" is emitted when there is an IRC response
    that indicate an error. See Mojo::IRC::Events for example events.

  ctcp_event_name
    Events that start with "ctcp_" is emitted if the "parser" can understand
    CTCP messages, and there is an CTCP response.

      $self->parser(Parse::IRC->new(ctcp => 1);

    See Mojo::IRC::Events for example events.

  irc_error
    This event is used to emit IRC errors. It is also possible for finer
    granularity to listen for events such as "err_nicknameinuse".

    NOTE: "irc_error" events are emitted even if you listen to "err_"
    events, but they are always emitted *after* the "err_" event.

  irc_event_name
    Events that start with "irc_" is emit when there is a normal IRC
    response. See Mojo::IRC::Events for example events.

ATTRIBUTES
  ioloop
    Holds an instance of Mojo::IOLoop.

  name
    The name of this IRC client. Defaults to "Mojo IRC".

  nick
    IRC nick name accessor. Default to "user".

  parser
      $self = $self->parser($obj);
      $self = $self->parser(Parse::IRC->new(ctcp => 1));
      $obj = $self->parser;

    Holds a Parse::IRC object by default.

  pass
    Password for authentication

  real_host
    Will be set by "irc_rpl_welcome". Holds the actual hostname of the IRC
    server that we are connected to.

  server
    Server name and optionally a port to connect to. Changing this while
    connected to the IRC server will issue a reconnect.

  tls
      $self->tls(undef) # disable (default)
      $self->tls({}) # enable

    Default is "undef" which disable TLS. Setting this to an empty hash will
    enable TLS and this module will load in default certs. It is also
    possible to set custom cert/key:

      $self->tls({ cert => "/path/to/client.crt", key => ... })

    This can be generated using

      # certtool --generate-privkey --outfile client.key
      # certtool --generate-self-signed --load-privkey client.key --outfile client.crt

  user
    IRC username. Defaults to current logged in user or falls back to
    "anonymous".

METHODS
  connect
      $self = $self->connect(\&callback);

    Will login to the IRC "server" and call &callback once connected. The
    &callback will be called once connected or if it fail to connect. The
    second argument will be an error message or empty string on success.

  ctcp
      $str = $self->ctcp(@str);

    This message will quote CTCP messages. Example:

      $self->write(PRIVMSG => nickname => $self->ctcp(TIME => time));

    The code above will write this message to IRC server:

      PRIVMSG nickname :\001TIME 1393006707\001

  disconnect
      $self->disconnect(\&callback);

    Will disconnect form the server and run the callback once it is done.

  register_default_event_handlers
      $self->register_default_event_handlers;

    This method sets up the default "DEFAULT EVENT HANDLERS" unless someone
    has already subscribed to the event.

  write
      $self->write(@str, \&callback);

    This method writes a message to the IRC server. @str will be
    concatenated with " " and "\r\n" will be appended. &callback is called
    once the message is delivered over the stream. The second argument to
    the callback will be an error message: Empty string on success and a
    description on error.

DEFAULT EVENT HANDLERS
  ctcp_ping
    Will respond to the sender with the difference in time.

      Ping reply from $sender: 0.53 second(s)

  ctcp_time
    Will respond to the sender with the current localtime. Example:

      TIME Fri Feb 21 18:56:50 2014

    NOTE! The localtime format may change.

  ctcp_version
    Will respond to the sender with:

      VERSION Mojo-IRC $VERSION

    NOTE! Additional information may be added later on.

  irc_nick
    Used to update the "nick" attribute when the nick has changed.

  irc_notice
    Responds to the server with "QUOTE PASS ..." if the notice contains
    "Ident broken...QUOTE PASS...".

  irc_ping
    Responds to the server with "PONG ...".

  irc_rpl_welcome
    Used to get the hostname of the server. Will also set up automatic PING
    requests to prevent timeout and update the "nick" attribute.

  err_nicknameinuse
    This handler will add "_" to the failed nick before trying to register
    again.
